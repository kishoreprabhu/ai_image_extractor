# Frontend (React)

## Project Initialization

1. `cd` into `frontend/`

2. Set your node environment

   - Run `nvm install && nvm use`, or

   - Alternatively manually set your node to v18+ and npm to v10+

3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

   Note: Ensure you have properly set your node version before this step

4. Run `npm run dev` to spin-up the frontend

   The terminal should display the port to view the frontend application in your browser (e.g. `http://localhost:5173/`).
